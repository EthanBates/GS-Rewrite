# GS-Rewrite
This is a rewrite of a pet project I made with WalrusWarrior, the goal is to be much more simplified and easy to work with than the older version.

So, what do you do in this game? Well... not much right now. Besides attacking random monsters and collecting gold and drinking potions until you take your last breath!

Here is a link to the original game that I am working off of: https://github.com/WalrusWarrior/Goblin-Slayer

More features will come soon!
